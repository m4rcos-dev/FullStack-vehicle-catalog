<p>The project's proposal was to create a vehicle catalog on a public page where it is possible to see registered vehicles and only the logged-in administrator can change, create and delete cars from the catalog.</p>
<p>All layers of the application (Models, Service and Controllers) were developed where it is possible to perform the basic operations on a given database: Creation, Reading and Deletion (or CRUD, for the most intimate üòú).</p >
<p>Endpoints were created to read and write in a database, using MySql.</p>
<p>A Front-End was developed with React to access endpoints and apply business rules together with the Back-End</p>

## üî® Project Resources

<ul>
<li>‚úÖEndPoint for vehicle registration, using the POST method</li>
<li>‚úÖEndPoint to list registered vehicles using the GET method.</li>
<li>‚úÖEndPoint with data filter and pagination, using the GET method</li>
<li>‚úÖEndPoint to list all vehicles, using the GET method</li>
<li>‚úÖEndPoint for user login, using the POST method.</li>
<li>‚úÖCRUD validations, user using token with JWT.</li>
<li>‚úÖManipulation and persistence of data using MySql database.</li>
<li>‚úÖComponentized database using Docker.</li>
</ul>

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running application

<details>
   <summary><strong>üê≥ Running all project dependencies</strong></summary><br />

   ## Utilities needed

   To run the application it is necessary to have `Docker`, `dotnet sdk` and `node` installed on the machine.

   ### The application is divided into 3 layers:
   - Database in MySql componentized in Docker.
   - BackEnd using the dotnet sdk framework.
   - FronteEnd using node and react frameworks.

   > Initially run the `database` in the folder that is in the root of the project then with the command below to upload the database.
   ````
   docker-compose up -d
   ````
   - Remember to stop `mysql` if you are using it locally on the default port (`3306`), or adapt it, if you want to use the application in containers
   - These services will initialize a container called `db_vehicles_catalog`.

   > After the container and the database are still running in the root of the folder, enter the `backEnd` folder and run the `migrations` to populate the `database` with the command:
````
dotnet ef database update
````

   > After running the `migrations` correctly run the command:
````
dotnet run.
````
   - It will build and run the backEnd application on ports 7267 and 5000.
   - Thus giving access to endpoints
   - `/Vehicle` with the `GET` `POST` methods and `/Vheicle/{id}` with the `GET` `PUT` `DELETE` methods.

   > In a new terminal go back to the root of the project and enter the folder called `frontEnd`

   > Install the dependencies with:
````
npm install
````

   > After installation run the application with the command:
````
npm start
````
   - the application will open in the browser running on `localhost:3000`

   ‚ö† Warning ‚ö† Do not run the npm audit fix command! It updates several project dependencies, and this update causes conflicts with the evaluator.

   ‚ö† Warning ‚ö† If you are using macOS and running `docker-compose up -d` you get the following error:

   ~~~bash
   The Compose file './docker-compose.yml' is invalid because:
   Unsupported config option for services.db: 'platform'
   Unsupported config option for services.node: 'platform'
   ~~~

> 2 possible solutions were found for this problem:
> 1. You can manually add the `platform: linux/amd64` option to the database service in the project's docker-compose.yml file, but this is a local solution and you should reproduce this for other projects.
> 2. You can manually add the line `export DOCKER_DEFAULT_PLATFORM=linux/amd64` to your computer's .bashrc, .zshenv or .zshrc files, this is a global solution.
> The solutions were based on [this source](https://stackoverflow.com/a/69636473).



‚ú® **Tip:** The `Remote - Containers` extension is indicated so that you can access Docker containers directly in VS Code, as you do with your local files.

<details>
   <summary><strong>üè¶ Users and Passwords</strong></summary><br />

   The application has a pre-registered default user and password and with its admin permissions activated in the bank. Use to test the application.

   > Email: admin@admin.com

   > Password: @Admin123

   The database uses docker already with the environment and data persistence variables, but below are the variables for a local configuration.

   ```
       MYSQL_DATABASE: vehicleCatalog
       MYSQL_USER: root
       MYSQL_PASSWORD: password
       MYSQL_HOST: localhost
       MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: password
   ```
