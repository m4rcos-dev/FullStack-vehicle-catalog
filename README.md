### [DEPLOY](https://karsshop.bohr.io/)

<p>The project's proposal was to create a vehicle catalog on a public page where it is possible to see registered vehicles and only the logged-in administrator can change, create and delete cars from the catalog.</p>
<p>All layers of the application (Models, Service and Controllers) were developed where it is possible to perform the basic operations on a given database: Creation, Reading and Deletion (or CRUD, for the most intimate üòú).</p >
<p>Endpoints were created to read and write in a database, using MySql.</p>
<p>A Front-End was developed with React to access endpoints and apply business rules together with the Back-End</p>

## üî® Project Resources

<ul>
<li>‚úÖEndPoint for vehicle registration, using the POST method</li>
<li>‚úÖEndPoint to list registered vehicles using the GET method.</li>
<li>‚úÖEndPoint with data filter and pagination, using the GET method</li>
<li>‚úÖEndPoint to list all vehicles, using the GET method</li>
<li>‚úÖEndPoint for user login, using the POST method.</li>
<li>‚úÖCRUD validations, user using token with JWT.</li>
<li>‚úÖManipulation and persistence of data using MySql database.</li>
<li>‚úÖComponentized database using Docker.</li>
</ul>

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running application

<details>
   <summary><strong>üê≥ Running all project dependencies</strong></summary><br />

   **‚ö†Ô∏è Before starting, your docker-compose needs to be at version 1.29 or higher. [See here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-compose-on-ubuntu-20-04-en) or [in the documentation](https ://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) how to install it. In the first article, you can replace where you are with `1.26.0` with `1.29.2`.**

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Run the `backend`, `frontend` and `db` services with the command:
```
  docker-compose up -d --build
```
   - Remember to stop `mysql` if you are using it locally on the default port (`3306`), or adapt it, if you want to use the application in containers;

   - These services will initialize a container named `backend_vheicles_catalog`, `fontend_vheicles_catalog` and another named `db_vheicles_catalog`;

   - From here you can access the application at `http://localhost:3000`;

   - The back-end endpoints are found at `http://localhost:5099`;

   - **‚ö†Ô∏è Attention:** Do not run the npm audit fix command! It updates several project dependencies, and this update causes conflicts.

   - ‚ú® **Tip:** The `Remote - Containers` extension is indicated so that you can develop your application in the Docker container directly in VS Code, as you do with your local files.

   <summary><strong>üè¶ Users and Passwords</strong></summary><br />

   The application has a pre-registered default user and password and with its admin permissions activated in the bank. Use to test the application.

   > Email: admin@admin.com

   > Password: @Admin123

   The database uses docker already with the environment and data persistence variables, but below are the variables for a local configuration.

   ```
       MYSQL_DATABASE: vehicleCatalog
       MYSQL_USER: root
       MYSQL_PASSWORD: password
       MYSQL_HOST: localhost
       MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: password
   ```
